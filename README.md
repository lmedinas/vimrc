# vimrc
 My initial .vimrc experiment

For years i've used Emacs and never looked deeply into vi except for extremely
cases where the local machine (embedded most of the times). Then i realized
how annyoing was to maintain my .emacs in order to bring it to a modern usable
state and i simply started to use something else. Sometime ago i was watching 
some Twitch streamers like ThePrimeagen and GeorgeHolz and realized how quickly 
and sane they were using vim to edit their code and i got interested to give 
a shot. Recently i got a new ARM Mac and vim 8.2 was already installed by 
default and i decided to give a try. This is my .vimrc experiment.
